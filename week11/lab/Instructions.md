This BankApplication is set up as a Maven project. Please install Maven to run the program. Maven is a tool to manage your Java applications following a specific structure. Maven allows you to specify configurations such as dependencies and plugins on the `pom.xml` file and automatically downloads them when you build the program.

Inside the `GUIBankAppSkeleton/` directory, we provide a skeleton of the program, and inside the `GUIBankApp/` directory, we provide the complete sample code.

Run the program inside the directory where the `pom.xml` file is placed. Use the command `mvn javafx:run`, which will look for the main class `GUIBankApp/BankApplication.java`.
